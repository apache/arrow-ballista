# Introduction

We welcome and encourage contributions of all kinds, such as:

1. Tickets with issue reports of feature requests
2. Documentation improvements
3. Code (PR or PR Review)

In addition to submitting new PRs, we have a healthy tradition of community members helping review each other's PRs. 
Doing so is a great way to help the community as well as get more familiar with Rust and the relevant codebases.

You can find a curated
[good-first-issue](https://github.com/apache/arrow-ballista/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
list to help you get started.

# Developer's Guide

This section describes how you can get started with Ballista development.

## Bootstrap Environment

Ballista contains components implemented in the following programming languages: 

- Rust (Scheduler and Executor processes, Client library)
- Python (Python bindings)
- Javascript (Scheduler Web UI)

### Rust Environment

We use the standard Rust development tools.

- `cargo build`
- `cargo fmt` to format the code
- `cargo test` to test
- etc.

Testing setup:

- `rustup update stable` DataFusion uses the latest stable release of rust

Formatting instructions:

- [ci/scripts/rust_fmt.sh](ci/scripts/rust_fmt.sh)
- [ci/scripts/rust_clippy.sh](ci/scripts/rust_clippy.sh)
- [ci/scripts/rust_toml_fmt.sh](ci/scripts/rust_toml_fmt.sh)

or run them all at once:

- [dev/rust_lint.sh](dev/rust_lint.sh)

### Python Environment

Refer to the instructions in the Python Bindings [README](./python/README.md)

### Javascript Environment

Refer to the instructions in the Scheduler Web UI [README](./ballista/scheduler/ui/README.md)

## How to format `.md` document

We are using `prettier` to format `.md` files.

You can either use `npm i -g prettier` to install it globally or use `npx` to run it as a standalone binary. Using `npx` required a working node environment. Upgrading to the latest prettier is recommended (by adding `--upgrade` to the `npm` command).

```bash
$ prettier --version
2.3.0
```

After you've confirmed your prettier version, you can format all the `.md` files:

```bash
prettier -w README.md {ballista,ballista-cli,benchmarks,dev,docs,examples,python}/**/*.md
```
